Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    Why JavaScript programming is amazing
    How to manipulate JSON data
    How to use request and fetch API
    How to read and write a file using fs module

Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using node (version 10.14.x)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/node
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: AirBnB style
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
    You are not allowed to use var

More Info
Install Node 10

$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Install semi-standard

Documentation

$ sudo npm install semistandard --global

Install request module and use it

Documentation

$ sudo npm install request --global
$ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules

Notes: Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).
